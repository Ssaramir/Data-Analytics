## Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis 

The Titanic dataset is a compelling collection of information, capturing the details of passengers onboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic, which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. The dataset provides a mix of numerical, categorical, and textual data, offering insights into aspects like socio-economic status, age, gender, and survival, among others.

The primary aim of this exploratory data analysis is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights from the data. I will seek to answer questions such as:

- What factors contributed most to survival?
- Were passengers of higher socio-economic status more likely to survive?
- How did age and gender play a role in survival rates?

In this EDA, we will employ various data visualization techniques and statistical methods to:

Understand the data's underlying structure.
1. Identify any missing values and anomalies.
2. Understand the distribution of key variables.
3. Investigate relationships and correlations between variables.

By the end of this analysis, we aim to have a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and the stories hidden within, paving the way for potential predictive modeling in subsequent phases.
